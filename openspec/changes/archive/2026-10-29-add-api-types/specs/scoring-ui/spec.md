# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Versions on every page

Every page SHALL show the API version, the engine version and each external tool with its version, as `GET /api/v1/versions` reports them and in the order reported, so a result can be traced to what produced it. A tool with a `null` version MUST be shown as not available, not left out. If the versions can't be loaded, the page MUST say so instead of showing an empty list, and the rest of the page MUST still work.

#### Scenario: All versions reported

- **WHEN** the user opens `/` and the API reports versions for the API, the engine and every tool
- **THEN** the page shows the API version, the engine version, and `blastp`, `hmmscan`, `hmmsearch` and `epa-ng` each with its version, in that order

#### Scenario: A tool is missing

- **WHEN** the user opens `/` and the API reports `epa-ng` with a `null` version
- **THEN** the page shows `epa-ng` as not available, and still shows the other tools with their versions

#### Scenario: Versions can't be loaded

- **WHEN** the user opens `/` and the versions request fails
- **THEN** the page says the versions are unavailable, shows no version numbers, and still shows the title and the home page content

#### Scenario: On the not-found page

- **WHEN** the user opens a URL that matches no route
- **THEN** the page shows the versions as it does on `/`

#### Scenario: Versions are not build details

- **WHEN** the page shows the versions
- **THEN** the versions text contains no port numbers, environment variable names, shell commands or file paths
